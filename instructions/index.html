      <h3>Begin the Game</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>There are six "role" cards (two tycoons, two complacents, two progressives). With three people, discard one of each role. With four people, discard one tycoon and one progressive, but keep two complacents. With five people, discard one tycoon only. With six people, keep all of the cards.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>If there are multiple of either politician type, they play on a team, having one turn for every one turn a tycoon has. However, if there are two tycoons, each tycoon would get their own turn (and the politicians would still each get one turn).</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Print out the board, tokens, and cards from the <a  target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19JUOHmW2DJyf2LhOBzbs3T0VFnAcp4r7?usp=sharing">Google Drive folder</a>.</li>
        <li>Randomly deal the role cards to each person. Have everyone reveal their roles and give them the appropriate card deck (if they are the tycoon). Place the "disaster" cards at the top of the board.</li>
        <li>Have an election. The tycoon cannot donate to either campaign in this election. The complacent politicians and the progressive politicians will each roll the die. The higher roll will be in power at least until someone lands on an election space.</li>
        <li>To begin the game, give the tycoon $700 and the government with $2k. There should be an unappropriated money bank, a government bank, and a tycoon bank.</li>
        <li>The tycoon always goes first. If there are two tycoons, each will roll the die. The tycoon with the higher roll will then go first.</li>
        <li>After the tycoon, continue in the clockwise direction, regardless of who is next.</li>
